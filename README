This is a re-write of James Ward tutorial - Play Framework, JPA, JSON, jQuery, & Heroku http://www.jamesward.com/2011/12/11/tutorial-play-framework-jpa-json-jquery-heroku

Using Play 2.0 Beta.  It seems JSON support was only recently added to the play framework and so it is not in the play framework jar file.  Instead I copied the JSON class out of the play source code.  I added the dependencies to the project/Build.scala



TODO

- Move the Script block into a variable in the index
- Basic Code Documentation
- How do you setup a production database configuration?
- What needs to be done to deploy to Heroku?
